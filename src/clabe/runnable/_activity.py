class ActivityIndicator:
    """
    Shared, thread-safe manager for a single live activity display.

    Owns a single ``rich.progress.Progress`` instance into which any number of
    concurrent runnables register an "activity". Because a terminal can only
    host one live region at a time, every activity shares the same ``Progress``
    so concurrent spinners render as separate rows (each with its own spinner
    and elapsed-time counter) instead of fighting over the terminal.

    The display is reference-counted: it starts when the first activity is
    entered and stops (clearing itself) when the last activity exits. This
    works for both blocking synchronous code running on worker threads and
    asynchronous code driven by an event loop.

    The indicator shares its ``Console`` with the logging handler so that log
    lines emitted while the display is live render cleanly above the spinners
    rather than corrupting them.

    Attributes:
        enabled: Whether the display is active. Defaults to ``False`` on
            non-interactive consoles (e.g. when output is piped to a file or
            running in CI), making every activity a no-op.

    Example:
        ```python
        indicator = ActivityIndicator()
        with indicator.activity("Running my-task"):
            do_blocking_work()
        ```

                display is enabled only when the console is an interactive
                terminal.
