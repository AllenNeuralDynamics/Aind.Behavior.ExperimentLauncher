"""A process-wide lock ensuring only one launcher session runs at a time.

Acquiring an exclusive session prevents a second launcher (for example a stray
extra browser connection to the web UI) from starting concurrently and fighting
over the rig — which could corrupt an ongoing acquisition.

The lock is an OS-level advisory lock held on a lock file (``msvcrt`` on Windows,
``fcntl`` on POSIX). The operating system releases the lock when the holding
process exits, even on a crash, so there are no stale locks to clean up.
