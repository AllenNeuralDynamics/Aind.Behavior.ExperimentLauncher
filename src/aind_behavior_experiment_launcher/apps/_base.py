    Abstract base class representing an application that can be run and managed.

    Attributes:
        None

    Methods:
        run() -> subprocess.CompletedProcess:
            Executes the application. Must be implemented by subclasses.
        output_from_result(allow_stderr: Optional[bool]) -> Self:
            Processes and returns the output from the application's result.
            Must be implemented by subclasses.
        result() -> subprocess.CompletedProcess:
            Retrieves the result of the application's execution.
            Must be implemented by subclasses.
        add_app_settings(*args, **kwargs) -> Self:
            Adds or updates application settings. Can be overridden by subclasses
            to provide specific behavior for managing application settings.

    Notes:
        Subclasses must implement the abstract methods and property to define the specific
        behavior of the application.
