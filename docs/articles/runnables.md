# Runnables

CLABE wraps its "do the thing" operations — running an app, transferring data,
checking resources — in a single decorator, `runnable`. Decorating a method
gives it, for free:

- a live **activity spinner** while it runs (a no-op on non-interactive
  consoles),
- structured **log lines** on start/finish/failure,
- user-facing **notifications** to the active frontend, and
- a seam for **OpenTelemetry** spans in the future.

Instead of hand-writing `notify(...)` calls and start/finish logging inside each
operation, decorate the method and let the shared lifecycle handle it.

## Decorating a method

```python
from clabe.runnable import ReportTier, runnable


class ResourceMonitor(Service):
    @runnable(name="Resource monitor")
    def run(self) -> bool: ...
```

The decorator forwards the return value unchanged and re-raises any exception
unchanged — it only *wraps* the call. It works on `async def` methods too
(detected automatically) and on plain functions.

If you omit `name`, it is derived at call time from the instance's class (so
subclasses report themselves):

```python
class _DefaultExecutorMixin:
    @runnable  # BonsaiApp().run() reports "BonsaiApp"
    def run(self, executor_kwargs=None) -> CommandResult:
        return self.command.execute(LocalExecutor(**(executor_kwargs or {})))
```

## Reporting tiers

How much a runnable reports is set by a `ReportTier`. Higher tiers are strictly
louder; each expands into the granular flags below.

| Tier | Spinner | Log | Notify on failure | Notify start/success |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `SILENT` | yes | debug | – | – |
| `FAILURES` *(default)* | yes | info | yes | – |
| `LIFECYCLE` | yes | info | yes | yes |
| `VERBOSE` | yes | info | yes | yes (with timing) |

Pin a tier (and an optional start message) on operations that always matter:

```python
@runnable(name="Transfer (watchdog)", tier=ReportTier.LIFECYCLE, notify="Transferring data…")
def transfer(self) -> None: ...
```

The spinner is always suppressed automatically when the console is not an
interactive terminal (e.g. piped output or CI).

## Configuring the house style

The global default is a [`RunnableSettings`][clabe.runnable.RunnableSettings],
loaded like any other service settings from the `runnable` section of the known
config files (or the environment):

```yaml
runnable:
  tier: LIFECYCLE      # everything announces start/success by default
  notify_success: false  # ...except keep success quiet
```

Resolution is most-specific-wins, per field:

```text
built-in tier defaults  ◁  RunnableSettings  ◁  @runnable(...) spec  ◁  call-site override
```

The launcher maps its verbosity flags onto the tier: `--debug-mode` → `VERBOSE`,
`--verbose` → `LIFECYCLE`, `--quiet` → `SILENT`. With no flag the configured
default is left untouched.

## Overriding at the call site

`runnable` can also rewrap an existing callable to override its settings for one
call — useful for an orchestrator bumping a step's verbosity without editing the
adapter:

```python
runnable(monitor.run, tier=ReportTier.VERBOSE)()  # one verbose run
runnable(monitor.run, tier=ReportTier.SILENT)()  # squelch one run
runnable(monitor.run, name="Disk check")()  # rename for one run
```

Rewrapping an already-decorated method **merges** over its baked-in spec rather
than nesting, so you never get two spinners or duplicate notifications.

## Nesting

When one runnable **directly calls** another (a plain call or `await`), the
inner one folds into the outer: only the **outermost** runnable shows a spinner
and emits start/success/failure notifications. Inner runnables still log. This
means an inner failure that the outer handles stays quiet, while a failure that
propagates all the way out is announced exactly once.

```python
@runnable(name="Transfer (robocopy)", tier=ReportTier.LIFECYCLE, notify="Transferring data…")
def transfer(self) -> None:
    self.run()  # the mixin's run() is also a runnable, but folds in here
```

Tasks spawned concurrently with `asyncio.gather()` or `asyncio.create_task()`
are **not** treated as nested — each is an independent lifecycle with its own
spinner and notifications. This is intentional: concurrent tasks are peers, not
children.

```python
@runnable(name="Experiment")
async def run_experiment(self) -> None:
    # Both subtasks get their own spinner and failure notification.
    await asyncio.gather(
        runnable(self.behavior.run_async, name="Behavior")(),
        runnable(self.physiology.run_async, name="Physiology")(),
    )
```

## Surfacing information to the user

There are two channels, and they should not be crossed:

- **Failures → the exception message.** On failure the lifecycle calls
  `notify(f"{name} failed: {exc}", ERROR)`, so the user-facing error is only as
  good as the exception's message. Don't add a side-channel — raise an exception
  that *says what went wrong*. This also composes with nesting: because only the
  outermost runnable notifies on failure, a detailed message is what survives to
  the top and is shown exactly once.

  ```python
  # Vague — the user sees "Resource monitor failed: constraints failed"
  raise RuntimeError("Resource monitor constraints failed.")

  # Actionable — the user sees "Resource monitor failed: Need 10GB free on C:\\"
  raise RuntimeError(constraint.on_fail())
  ```

- **Important non-failure info → an explicit `notify()`.** Warnings, partial
  outcomes, or notable state aren't lifecycle events, so call
  [`notify`][clabe.ui.notify] directly:

  ```python
  from clabe.ui import MessageLevel, notify

  notify("Found a single rig config; using it.", MessageLevel.WARNING)
  ```

Avoid doing **both** for the same event — don't `notify(detail, ERROR)` *and*
`raise` the same thing, or the user sees it twice (once immediately, once as the
runnable unwinds). For a failure, prefer the exception.

## Inheritance

Decoration follows normal attribute lookup:

- **Inherited without overriding** — works; the subclass uses the base's wrapped
  method.
- **Overridden** — the override is a plain method again; re-apply `@runnable` (or
  call `super().<method>()`) if you want it tracked.
- **Abstract methods** — decorate the concrete implementation, not the
  `@abstractmethod` (a wrapped abstract method is always replaced by the
  override anyway).
